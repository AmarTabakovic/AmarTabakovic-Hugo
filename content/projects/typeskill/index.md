As an avid mechanical keyboard enthusiast and hobby typist, I like to test my typing speed on sites like [Typeracer](https://typeracer.com) and [Monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com). For this reason, I decided to take on the challenge to create my own typing speed checker.

You can visit the project [here](https://main.d3l8q6oy8lf4vc.amplifyapp.com/).

**Technologies used:**
- Vue.js
- HTML
- CSS

**Hosted on:** AWS Amplify
