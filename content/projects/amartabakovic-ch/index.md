For a while now, I wanted to create a personal website. I originally envisioned to develop it in plain HTML and CSS, then in Webpack and JS, afterwards in Vue.js and now I've decided once and for all to use Hugo for this matter. The key points are fast build times, relative ease to get into and a resourceful community. 

**Technologies used:**
- Hugo
- HTML
- SCSS

**Hosted on:** AWS Amplify

## Styling

An important part of this site is the look and feel.

### Two tone color scheme

I have decided to go with a simple two tone color scheme, consisting of the following colors:
- navy: #04173b
- white: #ffffff

This site includes a dark mode. If you want to learn more about my implementation, you can read [my blog post about it](https://amartabakovic.ch/blog/hugo-dark-theme).


### Typography

For the fonts, I used [Playfair Display](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Playfair+Display?preview.text_type=custom) and [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter?preview.text_type=custom), both of which are available from Google Fonts.

A main advantage of using Hugo is its incredibly fast build speeds.
