## Desk Setup

Before I set up my current desk, I had an antique table from the 18th century. While it did serve its purpose well and is still a very sturdy piece of furniture up to this day, I felt the need for something a little more... contemporary.

While looking around on the internet for a viable desk, I stumbled upon an [entire Reddit community of people using two IKEA drawers and an IKEA countertop](https://www.reddit.com/r/ikeaPCstations/). I liked the simplicity of the idea and went ahead and got myself two [IKEA Alex drawers](https://www.ikea.com/ch/de/p/alex-schubladenelement-schwarzbraun-60473548/) and an [IKEA Karlby countertop](https://www.ikea.com/ch/de/p/karlby-arbeitsplatte-nussbaum-furnier-30335191/).

I used some scotch tape and anti-slip mats between the drawers and the countertop for more stability (sounds rudimentary, I know). To avoid any warping of the countertop, I installed the [IKEA Adils leg](https://www.ikea.com/ch/de/p/adils-bein-schwarz-70217973/) in the middle of it.

## Tech Setup

I use two [Dell P2720D 27-inch monitors](https://www.digitec.ch/de/s1/product/dell-p2720d-27-2560-x-1440-pixels-monitor-12398578?gclid=Cj0KCQjw8IaGBhCHARIsAGIRRYqzLfpD2H3_Jcn_GoEuJJdFdM25GSkfFzac5A1-LrxivXBcmyZifHYaAgLSEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds), both of which are mounted on a [monitor stand](https://www.digitec.ch/de/s1/product/neomounts-by-newstar-fpma-d960d-tisch-27-monitorhalterung-2737576). On top of the left monitor, I have a [Logitech StreamCam webcam](https://www.digitec.ch/de/s1/product/logitech-streamcam-2mpx-webcam-12926543) set up for video calls. 

My MacBook is usually held up vertically by the [Macally VCSTAND laptop stand](https://www.digitec.ch/de/s1/product/macally-vcstand-notebook-unterlage-10978583?utm_campaign=organicshopping&utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic). As for peripherals, I use the [Ducky One 2 Mini with Cherry MX Red switches](https://www.digitec.ch/de/s1/product/ducky-one-2-mini-de-kabelgebunden-tastatur-12826089) equipped with custom blank keycaps. The mouse I primarily use is the [Logitech MX Master 3 for Mac](https://www.digitec.ch/de/s1/product/logitech-mx-master-3-for-mac-kabellos-maus-11873888).

To connect it all together, I use the [Belkin Thunderbolt 3 Dock Plus docking station](https://www.digitec.ch/de/s1/product/belkin-thunderbolt-3-dock-plus-displayport-125w-usb-c-usb-a-dockingstation-12595546), which has served me great so far.

To power it all, I've taped a power strip to the underside of the countertop with some scotch tape and installed an [IKEA Signum cable tray](https://www.ikea.com/ch/de/p/signum-kabelkanal-waagerecht-silberfarben-30200253/) to hide all the cables.
