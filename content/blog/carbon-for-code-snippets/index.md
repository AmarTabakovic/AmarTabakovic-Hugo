[Carbon](https://carbon.now.sh) is a web-based code snippet generator, which you can use to create screenshots of your source code. Carbon supports syntax highlighting for over 60 languages and is highly customizable.

Compared to creating a screenshot of the code editor or copying the code and pasting it into a Word OpenDocument object, this is much easier and aesthetically more pleasant (atleast in my opinion).
