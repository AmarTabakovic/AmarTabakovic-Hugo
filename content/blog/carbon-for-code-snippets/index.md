[Carbon](https://carbon.now.sh) is a web based code snippet creator, which you can use to create screenshots of your source code. Carbon supports syntax highlighting for over 60 languages and is highly customizable.

Compared to creating a screenshot of the code editor or copying the code and pasting it into a Word OpenDocument object, this is much easier and aesthetically more pleasant (atleast in my opinion).
